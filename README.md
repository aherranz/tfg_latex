# LaTeX template for "Trabajo fin de grado" at ETSIINF / UPM

You will need a full installation of LaTeX (eg. Ubuntu packages `texlive-full` and `biber`).

## Making your PDF

See the `Makefile`.

## Code

Our recommendation is to use package `listings`, in fact is the package included by the style.
